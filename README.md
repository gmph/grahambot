# GrahamBot

The code in this repo is based heavily on the work of @yukuku's [telebot](https://github.com/yukuku/telebot). This starter kit will help you set your bot up and get it deployed on Google App Engine.

My additions include admin user profiles, contact recording in a database, dynamic message setting with a database, conditional message forwarding and a few more things.

Development of this repo is still in progress...
